# Problem Statement

This project aims to analyze and detect fraudulent financial transactions using a large-scale dataset provided by a financial company. The dataset contains over 1 million transaction records with detailed information such as transaction type, amount, origin and destination accounts, account balances before and after the transaction, and indicators for whether a transaction was fraudulent or flagged as suspicious

Data Description:-

Total Records: 1,048,576 transactions
Columns: 11 features

* step: Hourly time step of the transaction.
* type: Type of transaction (e.g., PAYMENT, TRANSFER, CASH_OUT).
* amount: Transaction amount.
* nameOrig and nameDest: Origin and destination customer IDs.
* oldbalanceOrg / newbalanceOrig: Senderâ€™s balance before and after transaction.
* oldbalanceDest / newbalanceDest: Receiverâ€™s balance before and after transaction.
* isFraud: Indicator (1 or 0) whether the transaction is fraudulent.
* isFlaggedFraud: Indicator for flagged fraud (by system rules).
* newbalanceOrig
* nameDest

# Summary

* The primary goal was to identify the patterns and behaviors that differentiate fraudulent activities from legitimate ones.
* To deepen the understanding, machine learning techniques were applied to identify the most influential features contributing to fraud prediction.
* The project proposed a series of infrastructure-level fraud prevention strategies, including real-time fraud detection, behavioral anomaly tracking, strict balance simulations, and enhanced user authentication for risky transaction types.
